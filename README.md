## What is OCO?

Off-chain operator (OCO) is an entity that performs actions or computations outside of the blockchain network. 

The integration of OCOs into the Mina Protocol ecosystem represents a significant step forward in enhancing the protocol's efficiency, scalability, and privacy capabilities. By offloading, Mina Protocol can streamline its operations and reduce its reliance on on-chain resources.
